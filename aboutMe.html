            Hey My People, I'm Keshon! I was born and raised in Lancaster,
            California, and I always had a fascination for technology. Even as a
            kid, I was always surrounded by technology like DVD/VCR players,
            BlackBerry phones, and Motorola Razrs from 2005. I found myself drawn to
            how these devices worked, especially when the first iPhone came out. But
            it was when we got our first home computer that my curiosity really took
            off. I spent hours in the loft of my house exploring how to create
            designs, playing around with Photoshop (back when it was free!), and
            building fun layouts for my MySpace page. I loved the creative freedom
            that technology gave me.

      <img src="/media/digital-marketing.jpg" alt="Digital Marketing" class="card-img-top">
      <p class="card-article p-2">
        But you know, even with all of this, I sometimes wondered if technology
        was truly my calling. After serving in the military, I found myself
        pulled back into the world of computers, diving into e-commerce,
        affiliate marketing, and digital design. I enjoyed learning new things,
        but I still felt like there was a piece missing. I wanted something that
        felt more like me, something that really sparked my passion.

      <p class="card-article p-3">
        Then, one day, I got the chance to build a website for someone, and
        everything changed. I was so excited to finally put my skills to use,
        but I didn’t want to just use a standard website builder like Wix or
        WordPress. I wanted to really build something from scratch. After days
        of searching for the right approach, I came across Rich Armstrong's
        course on Skill Share on how to hand-code a website using HTML and CSS.
        That course opened my eyes to what broader possibilities that are in
        design, and suddenly everything clicked. I knew this was the path for
        me.

        If you're curious about web design or anything technology-related, I'd
        love to connect with you. Whether you have ideas you'd like to explore
        or just want to chat about creative possibilities, I’m always open to
        new connections. I believe that great collaboration grows from shared
        interests and a genuine desire to create something meaningful. Let’s
        connect and see where our ideas can take us.

        <li class="item">
          I enjoy my family time, I am married with 2 handsome boys. My family
          means the world to me and making sure that they are loved and giving
          the opportunity to be them is what means the world to me.
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          I enjoy reading because I like my imagination to take flight and when
          I am reading a book, I look to understand it from the authors point of
          view which can be a different way than how it was actually interpreted
          in the book.
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          I love building projects, its starting from nothing and building into
          something and watching my ideas or someone's concept flourish which is
          why I enjoy to do it even in my off time
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          I have a love/hate relationship when it comes to working out because
          there are times I don’t want to work out but since I know if I don’t I
          am not challenging my self to where I need to be which is why I need
          to work out the way that I do
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          I love making graphic designs, it is watching what I am thinking in my
          mind come into the design and literally watching the concept build in
          a way that I never thought possible, I believe its a beautiful thing
          to see.
        </li>
        <li class="item">
          I love making videos, ever since I was younger making music and making
          videos has always been an inner passion of mine and I have always
          found the enjoyment in grasping old beats and aligning it in within
          the new and making a video and watching life's experience develop
          through my eyes.

          One of the most important things to me is staying true to what I

          that anyone does. My mission is to focus on continuous growth toward
          anything on my mind. Whether it's learning a new skill, developing a
          project, or just taking time to reflect, I believe in always pushing
          myself to be better while staying grounded. I also value coming
          together and collaborating with others, which brings the most
          fulfillment. My family is also a central part of my life, and they
