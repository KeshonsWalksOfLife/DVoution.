        My core beliefs are spiritual in nature. Do I believe in God?
        Absolutely. Do I believe Jesus died on the cross for me to live,
        breathe, and see another day? Without a doubt. I believe that God the
        Father is inside each and every one of us. We are created in His
        likeness and flow in His nature as beings like Him. To me, this means
        that we are the true controllers of our lives, empowered by God’s
        spirit. My life is a reflection of the thoughts I have allowed myself to
        believe are true.
      </p>
      <p class="christian">
        From my perspective, God is all about life and loving thy neighbor,
        regardless of feelings or emotions that may arise. God is the creator of
        many things, but nature and humanity are His greatest creations. As
        humans, we can create from the same divine inspiration, using the tools
        and resources already given to us. These tools are within our reach, but
        it is up to each person to realize this within themselves. The "I"—our
        true essence—is the blessing of life. The "I" must find purpose, which
        in turn brings meaning to God and Jesus Christ, leading to fulfillment
        and everlasting life.
      </p>
      <p class="christian">
        I've found communities through Reddit and connections with others who
        feel drawn to this path, but many resources I've encountered haven't
        fully guided me in this direction. Much of my journey has been through
        self-discovery. This has given me purpose, motivating me to become my
        best self. While understanding right and wrong, I've come to see that
        these concepts are polar opposites shaped by upbringing and environment.
        Right and wrong are often subjective, influenced by individual beliefs
        and perspectives.
      </p>
      <p class="christian">
        Through these experiences, my faith in God has become unwavering.
        Trusting Him is something I do without question. I've seen His work in
        my life, helping me remember who I am and showing me His goodness time
        and time again. I have transformed from a place of no hope to a place of
        limitless possibilities. My life is truly filled with joy because that
        is what I believe, and it hasn’t let me down.
